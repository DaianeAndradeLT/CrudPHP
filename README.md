# CrudPHP
The objective of this project is to develop a simplified CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with a database connection. This project is part of my college assignment submission.

The project centers around a wedding invitation management system. Its purpose is to enable users to effectively organize wedding invitations by offering key features such as guest registration, access to the guest list, as well as options for deletion and modification.

Key Features:

User-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.
Seamless database connectivity for storing and retrieving guest information.
Guest registration functionality for adding new entries to the guest list.
Access to a comprehensive guest list for easy reference.
Efficient deletion and modification options to manage the guest list effectively.
This CRUD-based application provides an intuitive and streamlined solution for organizing wedding invitations, simplifying the management process for a memorable and hassle-free wedding experience.
